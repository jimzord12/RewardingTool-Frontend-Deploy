## Description
### Purpose
Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, this decentralized application (DApp) seeks to heighten user engagement and foster loyalty within our platform by dispensing MGS Tokens as rewards to users.

### The MGS Tokens
#### Usage
he primary concept underlying these tokens is to foster a secure, decentralized, and automated reward system for our platform users. This system recognizes and rewards user participation in specific events or general usage of our platform's web services.

#### Acquisition of MGS Tokens
Users can accumulate these tokens upon the successful completion of predefined actions or tasks.
<br />

For instance, take the example of our Social Forum Web Application within the platform. Here, user actions like voting on a post or comment, or submitting a comment, trigger a pop-up notification informing the user of a potential reward. 
This reward, in the form of MGS Tokens, serves as an acknowledgement of their contribution to the platform's community.
